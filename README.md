 ## Coding Assignment
 ## Assignment 
Please note that it would be preferable to avoid relying on built-in methods such as collections, shuffle 
in Java, or arrow functions of JavaScript. Instead, creating a method or function from scratch and using 
your own logic in the assignment would be worth considering. 

1- JAVA<br>
* Create an array with the values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) and shuffle it. <br>
* Enter a Roman Number as input and convert it to an integer. (ex IX = 9) <br>
* Check if the input is pangram or not. (Pangram is a sentence that contains all the alphabet from a-z).

 2- JavaScript <br>
* Take a sentence as an input and reverse every word in that sentence. <br>
  Example - This is a sunny day > shiT si a ynnus yad. <br>
* Perform sorting of an array in descending order.
  
3A. HTML <br>

* Create a basic calculator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with the functionality of add, 
subtract, multiply and divide. <br>

3B . Survey Form <br>
* Create a survey form with Fields; First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Country (dropdown), 
Gender (checkbox), Profession, email, and mobile number. All the input fields are 
necessary to submit the form. Create two buttons Submit and Reset. Reset will reset the 
form while clicking on submit, first, it will check all the fields and necessary validations and 
then a popup will appear displaying all the selected values with the label in front of it. On 
closing the popup, the form should reset all the values.
